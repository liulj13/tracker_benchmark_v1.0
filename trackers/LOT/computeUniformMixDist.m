% Compute the "Uniform-Mix-Distance" between point sets X and Y
% Computes the distance between a set of points X in R^n to a second point or 
% set of points using a mixture-of-2-uniforms distance 
% 
% [d] = computeUniformMixDist(X,Y,alpha,R,S)
% 
% Input :
%             X - Input of data in Rn (X(:,1:2) = {x,y})
%             Y - Second point or set of points for distance calculation 
%                     Must have same number of rows as X or a single row
%             alpha - Mixture weight coef. 
%             R - Inner uniform support (for each dim)
%             S - Hyper-volume of probability space
% 
% Output:
%             d - Distances vector
