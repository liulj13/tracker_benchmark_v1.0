% Compute the "Gaussian-Distance" between point sets X and Y
% Computes the distance between a set of points X in R^n to a second point or 
% set of points using a multi-dimentional gaussian distance (with 0 mean)
% 
% [d] = computeGaussGaussDist(X,Y,sig)
% 
% Input :
%             X - Input of data in Rn (X(:,1:2) = {x,y})
%             Y - Second point or set of points for distance calculation 
%                     Must have same number of rows as X or a single row
%             sig - Gaussian sigma values
% 
% Output:
%             d - Distances vector
