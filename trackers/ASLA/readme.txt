This code is for the tracker published in the following paper.
Xu Jia, Huchuan Lu, and Ming-Hsuan Yang, Visual Tracking via Adaptive Structural Local Appearance Model, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2012), Providence, June, 2012

The code runs on Windows 7 with MATLAB 2009b.

The main tracking function is in tracker.m and the parameters related to image sequences are set in setTrackParam.m

The initial tracking uses two functions vl_kdtreebuild and vl_kdtreequery from the VLFeat open source library.

The formal tracking uses the following SPArse Modeling Software.

The results are slightly sensitive to affine parameters. You may obtain better results by adjusting the parameters.  


This is the first version of code. We appreciate any comments/suggestions. For more quetions, please contact us via jiayushenyang@gmail.com, lhchuan@dlut.edu.cn or mhyang@ucmerced.edu.
